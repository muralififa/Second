Hi Team,
I noticed a discrepancy regarding the password details for the account srcihub on devad.wellpoint.com.
In the attached screenshot from Password Manager, the “Last modified” date for this account is showing as 2/20/2025, 4:39:38 AM. However, in the summary table from the recent email notification about service ID password expiration, the “Last Set On” date for the same account appears as 1/22/2025.
Can you please help clarify why there is a difference between the two dates? Which one should be considered as the correct reference for the “Last Modified” or “Last Set” date for the password?
