Hi Vadim,

Thank you for the clarification.

At this time, I would like to withdraw my request for administrative access to the ServiceNow development environment. I initially submitted the request to understand how REST APIs are built within the platform, as it may help support my current process. However, I now understand the governance requirements around development activities and integration work.

If any access is required in the future, I will ensure to follow the appropriate process by creating a ticket and aligning with the Demand management guidelines.

Thank you again for your guidance.

Best regards,
Murali Tharan
